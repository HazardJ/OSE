### Why is this valid? There is no TARGETLICENSE.txt file!!
If there is no license file then the OSE hard codes the licenses to be either Creative Commons Share Alike 2.0 or the Affero General Public License 3.0 

These are keep-it-free licenses... if this bothers you get ahold of your licensor and try to get a license that you prefer.
