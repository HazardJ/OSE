### Why is this valid? There is no CONVERTDATE file!!
If there is no CONVERTDATE file, the OSE license hard codes the conversion date at 2 years from the download date.

Note that to properly CYA, you must post to a mailing list the fact that you are claiming that your download happened on a particular day. 

If you fail to do this, they you have the potential to get into a debate about when the file was downloaded.

Note that this hoop jumping is not needed if you have a CONVERSIONDATE hardcoded in a file
